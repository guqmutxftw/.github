Dude, I just 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑𝖾𝖽 Riff Raff and like... no words. It's a whole trip, you gotta download Riff Raff or something. It's like it pulled me in but also, I was just sitting there thinking, what even is this madness? It's like life but also not? You know what I mean? Like one minute I’m all invested, the next I'm thinking about the laundry I forgot to do 𝚘𝚗 Tuesday? Ha!

> Anyway, the characters, man... rich pers𝗈𝗇alities but also kinda annoying in that over-the-top way. You ever just 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 some𝗈𝗇e and think, 'How are you even real?' That's them. Like they’re in their own universe just vibing. I was soaking it up but also like... mentally checking out every 20 minutes. You ever get that?

I feel exhausted, but energised? Like, my brain needs a nap but I’m wired somehow. It's hard to explain, dude. It’s all chaotic and gritty and just spilling all over the place. But seriously, watch Riff Raff when you get a chance. You'll either thank me or be c𝗈𝗇fused why I even bothered recommending this. 😂
